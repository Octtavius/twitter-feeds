# twitter-feeds
This is a tutorial I did to get tweets without authentication.

It is a workaround to get tweets without authentication. The code, basically append some script tags dynamically then gets feeds of my account. If you comment out some codes there, you can see timelines, likes, etc.  However there is another way of getting tweets. 
1. Go to your twitter account, 
2. click on your profile on right top corner and choose "Settings and privacy"
3. click on "widgets"
4. click on "create new" and from drop down for example lets choose "profile"
5. click on the input field and a drop down list will show up with some links examples
6. choose profile and replace the profile name with your profile "https://twitter.com/Your_Profile"
7. choose display options
8. Finally, copy the generated link and put in your html page. 

It is simple and great because it also updates itself whenever a new tweet was posted on the account
